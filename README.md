Step-by-Step Approach:
Prepare the Data: Ensure your data is split into features (X) and labels (Y). The features will be the values in the columns, and the label will indicate whether the sample corresponds to a mine (M) or a rock (R).

Train/Test Split: Split your dataset into a training set and a testing set to evaluate model performance.

Choose a Model: Common classifiers for binary classification tasks include:
Logistic Regression

Train the Model: Train the chosen algorithm on the training set.

Evaluate the Model: Test the model on the testing set to see how well it performs.

Make Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
